Hi there,

I am currently doing my bachelors in Computer Science (Honours) at the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a> with a specialization in Software Engineering and working as a web developer at the Government of Manitoba. This is my GitHub profile where you will find a lot of awesome and also embarrassing projects. I usually don't have anything to do in my free time and also I love nerding out about creative projects, so don't hesitate to <a href = "https://jayedrafi.com">reach out!</a> 🙂 </p>

<p>❗️<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note:</strong> If you are not familiar with Java compiling, I recommend you to use <a href="https://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a>. It will be easier for you as you just need to drag and drop .java file and it's ready to run!</p>
