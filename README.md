### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>My name is <strong>Jayed</strong>, a future software engineer. I am currently doing my bachelors in Computer Science (Honours) at the University of Manitoba and currently working as a web developer at the Government of Manitoba. This is my GitHub profile where you will find a lot of awesome and also embarrassing projects. I usually don't have anything to do in my free time and also I love nerding out about creative projects, so don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
